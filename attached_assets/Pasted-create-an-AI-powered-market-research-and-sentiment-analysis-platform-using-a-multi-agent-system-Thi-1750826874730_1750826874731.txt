create an AI-powered market research and sentiment analysis platform using a multi-agent system. This platform would leverage the hackathon's sponsored tools—Tavily, Appwrite, CopilotKit, Mem0, and Keywords AI—to deliver real-time, actionable business insights through a conversational interface.

What It Does
The platform addresses a key business need: understanding brand perception and market trends in real time. It uses a team of specialized AI agents that work together to:

Crawl the web for mentions of specific keywords, companies, or products.
Analyze sentiment to determine if the feedback is positive, negative, or neutral.
Generate reports with insights and actionable suggestions.
Interact with users via a chat interface, making the insights easy to access and explore.
How It Works
The system is built as a multi-agent architecture, where each agent has a specific role:

Crawler Agent
Tool Used: Tavily (credits and beta access to Tavily Crawl)
Function: Continuously scans the web, including social media and news sites, for relevant data based on user-specified keywords (e.g., a company name or product).
Example: If a user inputs "Brand X," the agent fetches recent mentions from Twitter, blogs, and forums.
Analyzer Agent
Tool Used: An open-source LLM (monitored by Keywords AI credits)
Function: Processes the crawled data to perform sentiment analysis, classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral. Keywords AI ensures the language model's performance is tracked and optimized.
Example: Analyzes a tweet like "Love my new Brand X phone!" as positive sentiment.
Reporter Agent
Tool Used: Appwrite (cloud credits for backend services)
Function: Compiles the analyzed data into concise reports or summaries, stored in Appwrite’s database, and generates suggestions (e.g., "Negative sentiment detected—consider addressing customer complaints").
Example: Produces a report showing 70% positive sentiment for Brand X over the past week.
Interface Agent
Tool Used: CopilotKit (for conversational AI features)
Function: Provides a chat-based interface where users can ask questions like "What’s the sentiment for Brand X?" or "Show me the latest report." CopilotKit powers this interactive experience.
Example: User types "How’s Brand X doing?" and the agent replies, "Current sentiment is 70% positive, with a spike in mentions today."
Supporting Features
Memory Management
Tool Used: Mem0 (Pro credits for agent memory layer)
Function: Remembers user preferences (e.g., frequently monitored keywords) and past interactions to personalize responses and streamline workflows.
Example: Recalls that a user prefers weekly sentiment updates for "Brand X."
Data Storage and Security
Tool Used: Appwrite (databases, authentication, storage)
Function: Stores crawled data, analysis results, and user profiles securely. Handles user authentication so businesses can access their insights via a public URL.
Example: A marketing team logs in to view their dashboard and reports.
Frontend Interface
Tool Used: Superdev.build (credits for no-code vibe coding) or a simple JavaScript framework hosted via Appwrite
Function: While the primary interaction is chat-based, a lightweight dashboard could visualize trends (e.g., a graph of sentiment over time) if time permits. Superdev might be used for rapid prototyping.
Example: Displays a line chart of Brand X’s sentiment fluctuations.
