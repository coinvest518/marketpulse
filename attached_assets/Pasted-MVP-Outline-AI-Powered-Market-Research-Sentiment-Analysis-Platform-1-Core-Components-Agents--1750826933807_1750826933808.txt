MVP Outline: AI-Powered Market Research & Sentiment Analysis Platform

1. Core Components (Agents)

The platform consists of four specialized AI agents:

Crawler Agent





Purpose: Fetch real-time data (e.g., mentions, articles, posts) based on user-specified keywords.



Tool: Tavily (web crawling API).



Functionality:





Accept user keywords (e.g., "Brand X").



Crawl web sources using Tavily’s API.



Pass data to the Analyzer Agent.



MVP Scope: Basic keyword-based crawling for recent data.

Analyzer Agent





Purpose: Perform sentiment analysis on crawled data (positive, negative, neutral).



Tool: Open-source LLM (e.g., Hugging Face model) with Keywords AI for monitoring.



Functionality:





Receive data from Crawler Agent.



Analyze sentiment using the LLM.



Monitor performance with Keywords AI.



Pass results to the Reporter Agent.



MVP Scope: Simple sentiment classification.

Reporter Agent





Purpose: Compile sentiment results into reports and store them.



Tool: Appwrite (cloud database and storage).



Functionality:





Receive sentiment data from Analyzer Agent.



Store data in Appwrite’s database.



Generate a basic report (e.g., sentiment percentages).



MVP Scope: Store data and provide a summary report.

Interface Agent





Purpose: Provide a chat interface for user queries and insights.



Tool: CopilotKit (conversational AI).



Functionality:





Handle queries like "What’s the sentiment for Brand X?"



Retrieve data from Appwrite’s database.



Respond conversationally.



MVP Scope: Basic query handling for sentiment and reports.

2. Supporting Features





Memory Management:





Tool: Mem0 (agent memory layer).



Purpose: Store user preferences (e.g., keywords) for the Interface Agent.



MVP Scope: Remember frequently used keywords.



User Authentication:





Tool: Appwrite (authentication).



Purpose: Secure user access to data.



MVP Scope: Basic login system.

3. User Flow





User logs in via Appwrite authentication.



User inputs keywords to monitor.



Crawler Agent fetches data using Tavily.



Analyzer Agent processes data for sentiment.



Reporter Agent stores results and generates a report.



User queries the Interface Agent (e.g., "What’s the sentiment for Brand X?").



Interface Agent retrieves and delivers the response.

4. Technical Implementation





Agent Communication: Sequential workflow (Crawler → Analyzer → Reporter; Interface queries database independently).



Data Storage: Appwrite database for user data, crawled data (if needed), and reports.



Deployment: Host on Appwrite’s cloud with a public URL.



Frontend: Chat interface via CopilotKit.

5. Development Timeline (4 Days)





Day 1: Setup project, Appwrite auth, start Crawler Agent.



Day 2: Finish Crawler, start Analyzer with LLM and Keywords AI.



Day 3: Complete Analyzer, build Reporter with Appwrite.



Day 4: Implement Interface Agent, test workflow, prepare demo.

6. Key Features for MVP





Real-time data crawling and sentiment analysis.



Conversational interface for user insights.



Secure user authentication and data storage.

This MVP provides a complete, functional solution for the hackathon, showcasing a multi-agent system with practical market research capabilities.
